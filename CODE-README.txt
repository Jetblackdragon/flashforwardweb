HOW TO RUN:
    - go to terminal
    - type: npm run dev
    - a link will appear, click it
    - you will have locally hosted it

THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR MAKING MORE PAGES ARE IN Navbar.jsx

NO TOUCHIES:
    - index.html
    - package.json and package-lock.json
    - main.jsx
    - vite.config.js
    - node_modules
    - gitignore (tbh no idea what it does, just we should leave it alone.)

WHEN STYLING INDIVIDUAL PAGES, DO IT IN THE RESPECTIVE .css FILE ex: to style Home.jsx, do it in the Home.css

IF YOU NEED TO DISPLAY SOME HTML, DO IT IN A JSX FILE AND DISPLAY IT.
